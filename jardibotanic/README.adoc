Jardi Botanic Network profiles
==============================

Each node has it's own profile named after the node name, plus there is one
+nodes+ which is the base out of which all the others have been created just by
copying it and changing some details (as less as possible) such as hostname, ip
address and in some cases wan interface assingation.
