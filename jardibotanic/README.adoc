Jardi Botanic Network profiles
==============================

Each node has it's own profile named after the node name, plus there is one
+nodes+ which is the base out of which all the others have been created just by
copying it and changing some details (as less as possible) such as hostname, ip
address and in some cases wan interface assingation.

The profile +mArcFlex+ is based on +nodes+ with few modifications to work well
on +flex mArch+ devices, this profile should be used as base for node specific
profiles in case the node uses +flex mArch+ devices.

CAUTION: +mArcFlex+ profile and derivatice have PoE pass-through enabled by default
