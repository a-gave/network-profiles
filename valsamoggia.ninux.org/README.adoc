Outdoor network Valsamoggia
======

### 5700m distances

Notable differences from defaults:

* domain changed from `lan` to `valsamoggia.ninux.org`
* IPv4 `10.%N1.128.0/16/17` autogenerates just in the second half of the /16 broadcast domain
* DHCP range starts from 10.%N1.20.0 (start = 20*256 = 5120)
* DHCP range ends at 10.%N1.127.255 (limit = (127-20)*256 +255+1 = 27648)
* removed unused lines (bmx*, olsr*, adhoc)
* removed VLAN from Babeld, so that I can avoid the ehternet + VLAN 802.1ad + Mediatek problem (unconfirmed)
* 5 GHz channels removed list's second entry, set to 48
* 5 GHz distance variable
* ap_ssid main ESSID changed to `valsamoggia.ninux.org`
* added country code to IT
* added a list with all the suggested LibreMesh packages
* added also prometheus packages
* added a uci-defaults script for enabling prometheus service
